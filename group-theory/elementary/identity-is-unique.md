title: The group identity is unique
---

## Statement

Let $G$ be a [group](@group). Then the identity of $G$ is unique.

## Proof

Suppose that $e$ and $f$ are both identities of $G$. Since $e$ is an identity, by property 2 of a [group](@group) we have $$e * f = e.$$ And since $f$ is an identity, again by property 2 we have $$e*f=f.$$ From this we conclude that $e=f$. That is, the identity is unique.

QED.
