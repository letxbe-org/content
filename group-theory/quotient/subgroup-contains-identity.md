title: Subgroup contains identity
---

## Statement

Let $G$ be a [group](@group) with identity $1$ and let $H \le G$ be a [subgroup](@subgroup). Then $1 \in H$.

## Proof

By definition of [subgroup](@subgroup) $H$ is non-empty, so let $x \in H$. By definition of [subgroup](@subgroup), $x^{-1} \in H$ and also $xx^{-1} = 1 \in H$.

QED.
