title: The inverse of the inverse is the original element
---

## Statement

Let $G$ be a group and $a \in G$ be some element. Then $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$.

## Proof

Since $a^{-1}$ is an inverse of $a$, we have that $a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = 1$. So conversely, $a$ is an inverse of $a^{-1}$. And since $(a^{-1})^{-1}$ is also an inverse of $a^{-1}$, by [@](@inverse-is-unique) we have that $(a^{-1})^{-1} = a$.

QED.
