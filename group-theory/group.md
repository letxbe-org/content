A **group** is an ordered pair $(G,*)$ where $G$ is a set and $*$ is a [binary operation](@binary-operation) satisfying:

1. The operation $*$ is [associative](@binary-operation).
2. There exists some element $1$, called the **identity** of $G$, such that $a * 1 = 1 * a = a$ for all $a \in G$.
3. For each $a \in G$ there exists some $a^{-1} \in G$, called the **inverse** of $a$, such that $a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = 1$.

The group $(G,*)$ is called **commutative** if the operation $*$ is [commutative](@binary-operation). The group $(G,*)$ is called **finite** if the set $G$ is finite.

Often, we will say that $G$ is a group when $(G,*)$ is a group.
