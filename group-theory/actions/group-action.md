title: Group Action

A **group action** of a [group](@group) $G$ on a set $A$ is a function $\cdot: G \times A \to A$, written as $(g,a) \mapsto g \cdot a$, satisfying:

-   $g_1 \cdot (g_2 \cdot a) = (g_1g_2) \cdot a \quad$ for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$ and $a \in A$.
-   $1 \cdot a = a \quad$ for all $a \in A$.

The group $G$ is then said to **act** on $A$.
