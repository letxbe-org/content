title: Quotient group
---

Let $G$ be a [group](@group) and $N \trianglelefteq G$ a [normal subgroup](@normal-subgroup).

Define the [binary operation](@binary-operation) $*$ called **coset multiplication** on the [set of cosets](@set-of-cosets) $G/N$ by $aN * bN = (ab)N$.

The **quotient group** $G/N$ is the [set](@set-of-cosets) $G/N$ with the [binary operation](@binary-operation) $*$.
