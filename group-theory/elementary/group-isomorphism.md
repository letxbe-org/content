title: Group isomorphism
---

Let $(G,*)$ and $(H,\circ)$ be [groups](@group). An **isomorphism** $\varphi$ between $G$ and $H$ is a function $\varphi: G \to H$ such that:

1. $\varphi(x*y) = \varphi(x) \circ \varphi(y)$ for all $x,y \in G$. That is, $\varphi$ is a [homomorphism](@group-homomorphism).
2. $\varphi$ is a bijection.

If there exists some isomorphism between $G$ and $H$, then $G$ and $H$ are said to be **isomorphic**, notation $G \cong H$.
